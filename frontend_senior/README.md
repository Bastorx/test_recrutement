# Hello Dear Planity Team,

Here's my version for solving this test. As my time is not infinite, I'm aware that I could have gone further (implementing unit tests, snapshots with Jest for example, cleaning up the code, not using react-scripts in favor of alternatives like Next Webpack). I'm currently developing a mobile application in Flutter, so I'm saving my time for my personal (or paid) projects. Nevertheless, your test was interesting and I thank you for it.

I look forward to talking with you.

Sincerely
